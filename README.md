# Repo-ease
Monitors changes made to a mock server. Interprets the changes made by Gemini and posts a summary on a dedicated Slack channel
# Proposed Workflow
The n8n workflow in the backend monitors a [custom repository](https://github.com/sshr666/Sample-for-hackathon). This repo is hardcoded for the MVP.
When a change is committed to the repository, n8n takes the changes made and creates a summary using Google Gemini. These changes are then posted on a [custom Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/heck-lht7266/shared_invite/zt-3ctwhlj45-OUGrYUtZw7IjnRF7hEVPog).
This repository also contains a JSON file with the n8n workflow. All the private information is encrypted.
# MVP Expiration
